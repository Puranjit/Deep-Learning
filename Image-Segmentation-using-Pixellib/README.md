# Image-Segmentation-using-Pixellib
You can just insert different images you wish in the pix.py file after installing libraries mentioned in requirements.txt<br>
This python code would run pixel-wise image segmentation on the images and form masks on objects detected with certain accuracies in the images<br>
You can download the _mask-rcnn-coco.h5 file from [link](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases)
