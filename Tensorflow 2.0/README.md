# Tensorflow 2.0
This repository gives a brief introduction on how to use latest version of Tensorflow 2.0 (Deep learning framework) to build up neural networks
<b>Convolutional Neural Network.ipynb</b> - jupyter notebook explains in detail on how to create a neural network and add different layers in the neural network.<br>
<b>tensorflow.keras cheat sheet.ipynb</b> - tips on how to use Keras API built over Tensorflow 2 for training CNN models<br>
<b>Tensorflow-Keras (Vanilla).py</b> - building a vanilla neural network using Tensorflow 2.0

## Deep learning project
I worked on a deep learning project during Spring 2022. I used the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fpeccia/weed-detection-in-soybean-crops) and prepared models using different architectures and trained them on this dataset.<br>
