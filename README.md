# Deep-learning
I am currently working on developing this repository. It will include python codes and jupyter notyebooks to understand deep learning algorithms. It will also include detailed pipeline on how to develop deep learning models from scratch. 
(The files are yet to be placed in correct order)

# Tensorflow-2.0
<b>Convolutional Neural Network.ipynb</b> - jupyter notebook explains in detail on how to create a neural network and add different layers in the neural network.<br>
<b>tensorflow.keras cheat sheet.ipynb</b> - tips on how to use Keras API built over Tensorflow 2 for training CNN models
