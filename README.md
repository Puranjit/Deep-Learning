# Deep-learning
I am currently working on developing this repository. It will include python codes and jupyter notyebooks to better understand deep learning models.
You can go over an amazing youtube series: <b>Deep Learning for Computer Vision by </b> <Font color = "Blue">Justin Johnson </Font> [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) to get in depth knowledge and better understanding regarding Deep Learning.

## Tensorflow-2.0
This repository gives a brief introduction on how to use latest version of Tensorflow 2.0 (Deep learning framework) to build up neural networks.

## PyTorch
This repository gives a brief introduction on PyTorch (Deep Learning framework) and some basic codes examples to start building Neural network from scratch

## Scikit-learn
This repository gives an introduction and some basics on how to use Scikit learn API to build neural network

## Image-Segmentation-using-Pixellib
This repository runs pixel-wise image segmentation on images and forms masks on the objects detected with certain accuracies
