# Deep-learning
I am currently working on developing this repository. It will include python codes and jupyter notyebooks to understand deep learning algorithms. It will also include detailed pipeline on how to develop deep learning models on a custom data from scratch using Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. 
You can go over this youtube series of course : <b>Deep Learning for Computer Vision by </b> <Font color = "Blue">Justin Johnson </Font> [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) to get in depth knowledge and better understanding regarding Deep Learning.

This repository gives a brief introduction on how to use latest version of Tensorflow 2.0 (Deep learning framework) to build up neural networks.

# PyTorch
This repository gives a brief introduction on PyTorch (Deep Learning framework) and some basic codes examples to start building Neural network from scratch

# Scikit-learn
This repository gives an introduction and some basics on how to use Scikit learn API to build neural network

# Image-Segmentation-using-Pixellib
This repository runs pixel-wise image segmentation on images and forms masks on the objects detected with certain accuracies
