Implementation of UnetR model on my ucstom dataset<br> 
UNetR model - The UNetR model (UNet with Transformers as the backbone) is a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture designed for medical image segmentation and other image analysis tasks. UNetR builds upon the traditional UNet model by integrating a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder to capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, while the decoder part retains the structure of the conventional UNet to reconstruct the fine-grained segmentation output.<br>
